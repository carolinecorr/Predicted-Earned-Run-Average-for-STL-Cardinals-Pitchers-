## Final Project: Predicting Earned Run Average for STL Cardinals Pitchers by Caroline Corr

This supervised machine learning project aims to predict the earned run average (ERA) of STL pitchers using a wide array of inputs, excluding the metrics directly involved in the calculation of ERA. Originally completed for Data Science with R 2 final project (Northwestern University, March 2025).

This project has been duplicated and relocated to my personal public GitHub repository. Minor changes were made to remove unnecessary components related to the course for ease of understanding for non-university affiliated viewers, but all of the original code and final outputs have been preserved. This repository only reflects the changes made during the relocation process; therefore, none of the commits relate to the original creation of this project's form and content.
